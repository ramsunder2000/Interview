/*Scalable Video Streaming:
•	Content Delivery Network (CDN): Utilize a CDN to distribute educational content across multiple servers located strategically around the globe. This ensures low latency and high availability by serving content from the nearest server to the user.
•	Adaptive Bitrate Streaming: Implement adaptive bitrate streaming to cater to users with different internet speeds. This involves encoding video content at multiple quality levels and dynamically adjusting the bitrate based on the user's network conditions.
•	Load Balancing: Employ load balancing techniques to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, ensuring scalability during high-traffic periods.

/*This algorithm outlines a basic framework for a scalable video streaming system. It includes classes for content servers, a content delivery network (CDN), load balancer, and the main video streaming system.
In this example, we assume a simple implementation of content servers and CDNs. In a real-world scenario, the CDN would include multiple servers distributed globally, and the load balancer would dynamically distribute incoming requests among these servers to ensure optimal performance and scalability. Additionally, adaptive bitrate streaming and other advanced features would be integrated for a complete solution.
